      <p>
        Richard Beck began his career in the music business at the age of 17, working as an assistant engineer at the legendary Basement Recording Studio in Wardour Street, London. After just three months he was promoted to Studio Manager working across all sections of record production and administration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two years later he went on to become the youngest ever National Radio Promotions Executive when he joined the in-house promotions department at Chrysalis Records. Working with hit acts including Sinead O’Connor, Billy Idol, Monie Love, Debbie Harry and Kenny Thomas, the highlight of his time there was securing the Number One spot for Chesney Hawkes with the smash single ‘I Am The One And Only’.
      </p>

      <p>
        Combining his experience of creating vast media interest around record releases and his love for live music, Richard joined the UK’s leading concert & events promoter MCP, as press and marketing manager, working with major names such as INXS, Guns N’ Roses, REM, Oasis, Bon Jovi, Metallica, U2, Crowded House and Simply Red.
      </p>

      <p>
        After three successful years at MCP, he was headhunted by entertainment publicity giants Laister Dickson (later LD Publicity) where he remained for 6 years, attaining director status. He worked on a variety of artists, celebrities and events including: Janet Jackson, Tina Arena, M People, BBMak, Capital FM’s ‘Party In The Park’ for The Prince’s Trust (3 Years), The BRIT Awards (5 Years), Songs & Vision (Wembley Stadium), The MTV Awards and The Rolling Stones ‘Voodoo Lounge’ and ‘Bridges To Babylon’ European tours.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1997, Richard was approached to head the international launch to break the then relatively unknown Canadian country artist Shania Twain. He put in place and executed the worldwide marketing and publicity campaign for her album ‘Come On Over’ which broke all the rules of music promotion. The album went straight to the top of the charts all over the World, selling 36 million copies along the way, making it the 5th biggest selling album of all time and the biggest selling album ever by a female artist.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a decade working in music marketing, PR and promotion, Richard was established as a prolific and ubiquitous name in the industry. In early 2001 he decided to gather his knowledge of PR, Promotions and Marketing and apply it to management, teaming-up with Chris Morrison at CMO Management Int. The CMO stable boasts an eclectic range of artists including Blur, Gorillaz, Morcheeba and Ultravox & Live Aid legend, Midge Ure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Richard set-up BIGBOY Management in 2002 bringing with him a wealth of international knowledge and experience in the areas of Artist Management, Marketing and PR, as well as clients: Shania Twain, Bruce Springsteen, Midge Ure and Mark Shaw (Then Jerico).
      </p>

      <p>
        BIGBOY’s first new artist signing, Russian pop superstar Ani Lorak, sold 4 million copies of her debut album and is currently selling out 70,000 capacity venues in Europe. In May 2008, Ani came second in the Eurovision Song Contest, representing her native Ukraine.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2002/2003 Richard was invited by the BBC to be a permanent judge on their ‘Just up Your Street’ TV talent show, a role for which he received critical acclaim.
      </p>

      <p>
        Late 2004 saw a move to Australia for a one-year project, teaming-up with music impresario Ralph Carr, to create one of the leading independent music organisations in Australia. Richard was the General Manager (Entertainment & Music Divisions), namely: RCM Artist Management, Standard Records, Standard Music Publishing and the newly created indie label, Illicit records. He also worked extensively on the first series of ‘X Factor’ in Australia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Richard returned to the UK in 2006 to concentrate again on the artist management side of the business. His roster then comprised of 5ive (Sony Music), RyanDan (Universal Music) and Vince Harder (Warner Music). He went on to also manage and develop RnB chart-topper Angel (Island Records), Dean Ray (Sony Music), Vanessa Amorosi (Island Records), Ezra Vine (Parlophone), Midnight Youth (Warner Music) & Dane Rumble (Ministry of Sound).
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2010, live music specialists Supernova Entertainment Ltd acquired BIGBOY Management and both companies now run side-by-side. Beck became the new CEO and majority shareholder of Supernova Ents Ltd.
